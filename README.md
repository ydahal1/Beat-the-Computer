This is a number guessing game. The computer will automatically generate a random number between 19 and 120 and your goal is to reach that number by clicking four coins that have hidden values. Every click will cumulate points and you can keep clicking the coins until you reach or exceed the computer generated number. You can play the game as many times as you want. Just click the play again button. If you want to reset the game you can do so by clicking reset game. Doing this will bring your attempts back to zero.
